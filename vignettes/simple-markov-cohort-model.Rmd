# Overview
We illustrate the implementation of a simple Markov cohort model by replicating the HIV model developed by [Chancellor et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00019053-199712010-00006) and used for didactic purposes in the [*Decision Modeling for Health Economic Evaluation*](https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/decision-modelling-for-health-economic-evaluation). The analysis compares two treatment strategies, zidovudine monotherapy and zidovudine + lamivudine combination therapy. The model is time-inhomogeneous because patients are assumed to only use lamivudine for 2 years before switching back to monotherapy.

The model consists 4 health states. Ordered from worst to best to worst, they are: State A (CD4 cells > 200 and < 500 cells/mm3), State B (CD4 < 200 cells/mm3), State C (AIDS), and State D (death). The model assumes that patients can transition to any state that is more severe (i.e., progress) but cannot transition back to a more severe state.

```{r, message=FALSE}
RR<-0.509

transitions_combi <- matrix(c((1-0.202*RR-0.067*RR-0.010*RR), 0.202*RR, 0.067*RR, 0.010*RR,
                                      0, (1-0.407*RR-0.012*RR), 0.407*RR, 0.012*RR,

                                      ncol = 4, nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
```

Lifeyears and costs by health state and discount rates
```{r, message=FALSE}
LY <- matrix(c(1, 1, 1, 0),nrow=1)

drug_cost_mono <- matrix(c(2278, 2278, 2278, 0),nrow=1)
drug_cost_combi <- matrix(c(2278+2087, 2278+2087, 2278+2087, 0),nrow=1)
other_cost <- matrix(c(2756, 3052, 9007, 0),nrow=1)

discount_LY <- 0.00
discount_cost <- 0.06
```

Define initial distribution 
```{r, message=FALSE}
initial<-matrix(c(1,0,0,0),nrow=1)
```

# Model Calculation 
## Health state occupancy
State occupancy with monotherapy at 1 year
```{r, message=FALSE}
initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 1)
```

State occupancy with monotherapy at 5 years
```{r, message=FALSE}
initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 5)
```

## Calculation of expected life years and costs
The discounted expected life years after 5 years of follow-up can be calculated as follows:
```{r, message=FALSE}
expected_LY_mono <- sum(
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 1) * LY * 1/(1+discount_LY)^1,
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 2) * LY * 1/(1+discount_LY)^2,
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 3) * LY * 1/(1+discount_LY)^3,
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 4) * LY * 1/(1+discount_LY)^4,
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 5) * LY * 1/(1+discount_LY)^5 
            )
expected_LY_mono
```

The discounted expected costs after 5 years of follow-up can be calculated as follows:
```{r, message=FALSE}
expected_total_cost_mono <- sum(
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 1) * (drug_cost_mono + other_cost) * 1/(1+discount_cost)^1,
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 2) * (drug_cost_mono + other_cost) * 1/(1+discount_cost)^2,
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 3) * (drug_cost_mono + other_cost) * 1/(1+discount_cost)^3,
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 4) * (drug_cost_mono + other_cost) * 1/(1+discount_cost)^4,
            initial %*% (transitions_mono %^% 5) * (drug_cost_mono + other_cost) * 1/(1+discount_cost)^5  
            ) 
expected_total_cost_mono
```


## Calculation of trace
Health state occupancy, discounted life years and discounted costs with monotherapy for a time-horizon of 20 years
```{r, message=FALSE}
follow_up <- 20
trace_mono<-matrix(rep(NA, 6 * follow_up), nrow=follow_up)
for(t in 1:follow_up){
trace_mono[t,1:4] <- initial %*% (transitions_mono %^%t)
trace_mono[t,5] <- sum(  trace_mono[t,1:4] * LY * 1/(1+discount_LY)^t  )
trace_mono[t,6] <- sum(  trace_mono[t,1:4] * (drug_cost_mono + other_cost) * 1/(1+discount_cost)^t  )
}
trace_mono
```


Health state occupancy, discounted life years and discounted costs with combination therapy for a time-horizon of 20 years. Please note combination therapy is only provided for 2 years (2 cycles). 
```{r, message=FALSE}
trace_combi<-matrix(rep(NA, 6 * follow_up), nrow=follow_up)
for(t in 1:2){
  trace_combi[t,1:4] <- initial %*% (transitions_combi %^%t)
  trace_combi[t,5] <- sum(  trace_combi[t,1:4] * LY * 1/(1+discount_LY)^t  )
  trace_combi[t,6] <- sum(  trace_combi[t,1:4] * (drug_cost_combi + other_cost) * 1/(1+discount_cost)^t  )
}
for(t in 3:follow_up){
  trace_combi[t,1:4] <- trace_combi[2,1:4] %*% (transitions_mono %^% (t-2))
  trace_combi[t,5] <- sum(  trace_combi[t,1:4] * LY * 1/(1+discount_LY)^t  )
  trace_combi[t,6] <- sum(  trace_combi[t,1:4] * (drug_cost_mono + other_cost) * 1/(1+discount_cost)^t  )
}
trace_combi
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
Expected_LY_mono <- sum(trace_mono[,5])
Expected_LY_mono
```
